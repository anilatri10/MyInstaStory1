Build "Instagram Stories" feature using Kotlin

Functional Requirements
Implement the following features:
A list of stories should be visible in a smaller view in a horizontally scrollable list.
The data for stories should be served by a backend API.
User should be able to start viewing one of the available stories from list.
Stories should automatically advance to the next one after a set duration (say 5 seconds).
The user should be able to manually navigate between stories using UI controls. Tapping on the left side of an open story should take
the user to the previous story. Tapping on the right side of an open story should take the suer to the next story.
Use animations or transitions for smoother story transitions and UI interactions.
